open("Welcome/To/OS2016", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3:

-open the file "OS2016" with  writing only premission.if the file exists and it is a regular 
file and the file is successfully opened it's length is truncated to zero. In addition, 
if the file - -exists open will faile
-with the following permissions-

fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0:

fstat() retrieve information about the file pointed to  by
pathname , the file about which information is to be retrieved is specified by the file descriptor fd.
The file is opened as a regural file and is total size is 0 bytes.
The file is with e following permissions-
-Special     	          User	                  Group                   Other

write(3, "                                "..., 192) = 192:

-Write in to the file it just open, the following string "                                " with
 up to 192 bytes from the buffer.

close(3)                                = 0:

It close the file it worked on.with succsses.

unlink("Welcome/To/OS2016")             = 0:

Remove the specified file with succsses.

rmdir("Welcome/To/")                    = 0:

Remove the following directory with succsses.

rmdir("Welcome/")                       = 0:

Remove the following directory with succsses.

exit_group(0)                           = ?:

Exit all thread in the process,and because the system called is not returned we recieve "?". 
+++ exited with 0 +++

Task2 :
General time checking - we have used the getTimeOfDay function in order to measure the 
time it takes to do certain operations.
the time we got is in microseconds so we multiplied it by 1000 to get nanoseconds.
we have also used each time couple of operations , and divided by that number of operations
in order to get a more accurate calculation.

Operation time - the operations we used are regular arithmetic operations like adding or substructing.

function time - the operations we used are just calling for an empty function , in order to get exactly 
the time it takes to call a function.

syscall time - the operations we used are just the OSM_NULLSYSCALL as mentioned in the exercise.

disk time - not implemented.
